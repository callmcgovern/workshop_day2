1. Make a subdirectory in each directory of sequences called outputs \

2. Combine all of the fasta files from each folder into one large fasta file per folder.\

3. Once you have done that, remove all of the individual seqs so that your folders only have two things in them.\

4. Count how many seqs you have in each of your big fasta files\

5. Count how many times 

Challenge: With one command, start in the parent directory (day2) and go into each folder and count in each of the files then save this into an output file called caca_count.\
